### LucidApp and LucidComponent

#### Store
This component is like a React::Component and in addition to it, allows do manage its state conveniently over redux using a simple DSL:
- `store` - works similar like the components state, but manages the components state with redux
- `class_store` - allows to have a class state, when changing this state, all instances of the components class render
- `app_store` - allows to access application state, when changing this state, all instances that have requested the same variables, will render.

The store data changes are passed using props instead of setting component state.
Therefore a LucidComponent needs a LucidApp as outer component.
LucidApp sets up a React::Context Provider, LucidComponent works as a React::Context Consumer.

```ruby

class MyComponent < LucidComponent::Base # is a React::Context Consumer

  render do
    # in a LucidComponent state can be used for local state managed by react:
    state.some_var
    # in addition to that, store can be used for local state managed by redux:
    store.a_var
    # and for managing class state:
    class_store.another_var
    # and for managing application wide state:
    app_store.yet_another_var
    #
    DIV { 'Some text' }
  end
end
```

Components that dont need to access the store, because they get all data passed via props for example, can opt out of store updates.
This can improve overall render performance:
```ruby
class MyComponent < LucidComponent::Base
  store_updates :off

  render do
    DIV app_store.some_text # store access is still possible,
    # but when app_store.some_text get changed, the component will not render

    DIV props.some_text # data changes that require a render must then be passed in props.
    # This is useful for table rows for example or other props that get all data in props.
  end
end
```

#### Theming and Styles
LucidApp also sets up theming. LucidApp and LucidComponents support styling:

```ruby
class MyApp < LucidApp::Base # is a React::Context Consumer
  # LucidApp can provide a styles theme, it can be referred to by the LucidComponent styles DSL, see below
  theme do
    { master: { width: 200 }}
  end

  # styles can be set using a block that returns a hash, the theme gets passed to the block as hash:
  styles do
    { root: {
        width: 200,
        height: 100
    }}
  end

  # or styles can be set using a hash:
  styles(root: { width: 100, height: 100 })

  # a component may refer to some other components styles, if those are given as hash.
  # If the other components styles are given as block, that wont work.
  styles(OtherComponent.styles.deep_merge({ root: {width: 100 }}))
  styles do
    OtherComponent.styles
  end

  render do
    DIV(class_name: styles.root) { 'Some text' }
  end
end
```
LucidComponents can access the theme from the outer LucidApp:
```ruby
class MyComponent < LucidComponent::Base # is a React::Context Consumer
  # styles can be set using a block that returns a hash, the theme gets passed to the block:
  styles do |theme|
    {
      root: {
        width: theme.master.width, # access the theme provided by LucidApp
        height: 100
      }
    }
  end

  # or styles can be set using a hash:
  styles(root: { width: 100, height: 100 })

  # a component may refer to some other components styles, if those are given as hash.
  # If the other components styles are given as block, that wont work.
  styles(OtherComponent.styles.deep_merge({ root: {width: 100 }}))
  styles do
    OtherComponent.styles
  end

  render do
    # in a LucidComponent state can be used for local state managed by react:
    state.some_var
    # in addition to that, store can be used for local state managed by redux:
    store.a_var
    # and for managing class state:
    class_store.another_var
    # and for managing application wide state:
    app_store.yet_another_var
    # during render styles can be accessed with `styles`:
    DIV(class_name: styles.root) { 'Some text' }
    # theme value from LucidMaterial::App can be accessed directly too:
    DIV(styles: { width: theme.master.width }.to_n) { 'Some text' }
    # note the .to_n, the styles property requires a native object
  end
end
```

#### Lifecycle callbacks

The lifecycle callbacks starting with `unsafe_` are not supported.
Overwriting should_component_update is also not supported.

#### Preloading Data before render
Data or anything else that returns a promise can be preloaded before rendering from within LucidComponents
```ruby
class MyComponent < LucidComponent::Base
  # Use preload to define what needs to be loaded. The block result must be a promise.
  preload do
     MyGraph.promise_load.then { |g| @graph = g }
  end

  # The block passed to while_loading will be rendered until the promise is resolved
  while_loading do
    DIV "Loading data ... Please wait ..."
  end

  # the usual render block is shown when the data has been loaded
  render do
    @graph.all_nodes.each do |node|
      DIV node.name
    end
  end
end
```
#### Execution Environment
Sometimes its useful to prevent execution or rendering during Server Side Rendering or execute code specifically in a certain environment.
For this the environment helpers can be used:
- `on_browser?` - true if executing on the browser
- `on_ssr?` - true if executing in Server Side Rendering

```ruby
class MyComponent < LucidComponent::Base
  # use preload to define what needs to be loaded. The block result must be a promise.
  preload do
    if on_browser?
      MyGraph.promise_load.then { |g| @graph = g } # load the graph only on the browser
    else
      Promise.new
    end
  end

  # the block passed to while_loading wil be rendered until the data is loaded
  # and the promise is resolved
  while_loading do
    DIV "Loading data ... Please wait ..."
  end

  # the usual render block is shown when the data has been loaded
  render do
    if on_browser?
      CANVAS do
        # a canvas cannot be drawn to in Server Side Rendering, so paint the canvas only on the browser
      end
    end
    @graph.all_nodes.each do |node|
      DIV node.name
    end
  end
end
```
